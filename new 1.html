        desc:"Senior high school has been a journey of growth and self-discovery for me. At first, I was afraid that I would end up being alone. It was difficult adjusting to a new environment, meeting new classmates, and trying to fit in. There were moments when I felt lost and unsure of myself, but little by little, I learned how to keep up with everyone else. Grade 11 felt like a blur because everything happened so fast, yet every experience was meaningful and worth my time. Now that I am in Grade 12, things feel different in the best way possible. I have my “quadro” with me, and having them by my side made this school year lighter and more memorable. Because of them, I was able to achieve so many things and push myself beyond my limits. This year was not easy—it was filled with tears, pressure, and sleepless nights—but it was all worth it. As I prepare to graduate, I promise to cherish every remaining moment while I am still a high school student and carry these memories with me into the next chapter of my life.",

Being able to attend these masses has become a meaningful part of my routine, a special time to reflect and connect with God. For me, it’s not just about personal prayer, but also seeing my fellow students come together in faith. Witnessing their devotion and feeling the shared spirit of worship makes me happy, knowing that these moments help bring all of us closer to the Lord."},

That experience allowed me to showcase my talent in dancing, meet new friends, and build confidence in myself. At first, I doubted whether I could do it, but I realized that with perseverance, anything is possible. Even though I may not have become a professional in dancesport, the more important is the lessons and experiences I gained and memories I will treasure forever and even share with my grandchildren someday."},

I felt exhausted from all the running, yet at the same time, I was happy and energized—sometimes wanting to rest but still joining in the activities. Maybe it was overwhelming because it was my first time, but it turned out to be such a meaningful experience. The fun run helped me get closer to my classmates, especially since during the first three months, I was still hesitant and didn’t have many friends. Through this event, we were able to open up to each other, building deeper connections and friendships that made my school life even more memorable."}

I felt the excitement, but I got anxious when I first reached the campus. The school environment was new to me, I met new people — including my classmates and teachers and a different responsibilities. I learned to adapt to senior high school requirements during my Grade 11 studies. The new sets of subject and its lessons to be studied, influence us to develop a better time management and foster our understanding to keep up. This new school environment taught me essential skills due to adapting a new learning environment, by developing a good time management and to be effective in handling multiple deadlines simultaneously — being productive and avoid procrastinating. I developed greater self-assurance and self-reliance in Grade 12. My relationships with others became stronger through building friendships which I believe will last throughout my life. I found my most important moments through project work and school activities and through sharing joyful times with my classmates. My teachers operated as instructors and mentors who assisted me with college preparation and dream chasing. Academia de Pulilan provided me with academic knowledge because it transformed me into a responsible person who shows respect while showing determination to reach my objectives. The lessons and character I developed over these two years prepared me for the next chapter of my life.",
